# For running the project

Clone the repo on your local machine. I hope you are having [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and [truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) already installed on your system. If not, please go ahead and download these from their official sites.

Now, head over to the root folder and run `npm install` to download the dependencies. After installation, just run `npm start` from the current directory.

Head over to another terminal and `cd truffle` into the truffle folder and run `truffle migrate` from there. Also, start the ganche-cli or the ganache local blockchain.

Move over to your metamask and import one and couple other accounts to this for transfering token among the accounts.

Head over to your browser and refresh the page. Hope this works fine for you! Have a great time!
